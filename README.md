# Nyaa~

Nyaa~, or Catgirl Simulator, was a game I was trying to make, but failed miserably at! It's a Google Chrome app written with AngularJS. I'm hoping that I might be able to come back to it some day, but I decided to upload it onto GitHub for now because I haven't really done anything with it for a while.

I'd really appreciate if you didn't do anything with these files, so the LICENSE file I have for now is just a simple thing that pretty much just states what I think is the default "license" for projects without a license! I might change it in the future, but I'd be really sad if you ended up making a better version of my game before I even get a chance to try making one. If you actually want to *help* me make this game, please [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/stawbewwi)!
